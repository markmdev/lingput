## The Challenge

Traditional language learning apps rely on flashcards and repetitive drills. **Lingput solves the real problem**: providing learners with **comprehensible input** - personalized stories at exactly their vocabulary level, complete with audio and smart word tracking.

## Impact & Performance

- **85% faster page load** (600ms ‚Üí 85ms) by implementing Redis caching to eliminate multiple redundant database queries
- **Zero-downtime deployments** with 80% reduction in deployment time (25min ‚Üí 5min)
- **Non-blocking user experience** replacing 30-second blocking API requests with async job queues and real-time progress updates
- **Production-ready architecture** handling concurrent AI processing and real-time progress updates

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### üèóÔ∏è Scalable Backend Design

- **Clean Architecture**: Multi-layered Express.js backend (Controller/Service/Repository) with dependency injection for maintainability and testability
- **Async Job Processing**: BullMQ + Redis job queue system offloads heavy AI tasks, enabling responsive API and real-time progress tracking
- **Intelligent Caching**: Redis-powered caching strategy dramatically reduces database load and API latency
- **Secure Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies with access/refresh token flow, protecting against XSS attacks

### ‚ö° Performance Engineering

- **Database Optimization**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, optimized queries and connection pooling
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching (Redis) for frequently accessed stories and vocabulary data
- **Background Processing**: Complex AI workflows (story generation, translation, audio synthesis) handled asynchronously
- **Resource Management**: Docker containerization with optimized resource allocation

### üîÑ Production DevOps

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, and deployment with GitHub Actions
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker Compose orchestration with NGINX reverse proxy
- **Monitoring & Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and job queue monitoring
